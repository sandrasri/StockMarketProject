# StockMarketProject

Stock market project where user can ask to see the data of any stock from the past 10-15 years. Created in June 2024 in Northeastern Universityâ€™s CS 3500: Object Oriented Design

The project launches and gives you two different sets of user interfaces, one text-based and another graphic user interface coded using Java Swing. However, the text-based code gives you more options to analyze such as calculations regarding x-day crossovers, x-day return, creating a portfolio and viewing its composition and distribution. These tools allow the user to accurately determine the best stocks for them and allow them to set portfolio weights easily.
